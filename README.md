# ThreeSixty

ThreeSixty is designed to be a minimal 360Â° feedback tool for engineering teams
and managers. It stands on the shoulders of Google App Suite and relies on those
to do all of its heavy lifting:

 - Using google forms to collect feedback data
 - Using google sheets to act as a data store
 - Using google apps scripts to provide the glue
