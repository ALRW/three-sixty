              <strong>360° Feedback</strong> is a process through which feedback
              for a person is gathered from a multitude of sources such as their
              subordinates, peers, managers and even customers or anyone that they
              interact with as well as from themselves. It aims to provide a
              fuller picture of the areas that a person should sustain and those
              where they should focus on improving.

            <p>
              This tool is designed to provide a bare-bones system for
              conducting this kind of feedback for teams and managers. It is not
              designed for performance appraisals but simple as a tool to
              support individual development.
