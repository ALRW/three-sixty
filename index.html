                <p>
                  <strong>360° Feedback</strong> is a process through which feedback
                  for a person is gathered from a multitude of sources such as their
                  subordinates, peers, managers and even customers or anyone that they
                  interact with as well as from themselves. It aims to provide a
                  fuller picture of the areas that a person should sustain and those
                  where they should focus on improving.
                </p>

                  This tool is designed to provide a bare-bones system for
                  conducting this kind of feedback for teams and managers. It is not
                  designed for performance appraisals but simple as a tool to
                  support individual development.
